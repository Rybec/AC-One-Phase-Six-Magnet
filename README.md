# AC-One-Phase-Six-Magnet

These are design files intended to be used with a laser cutter to cut out structural components for a one-phase AC generator.

This generator design has been produced once and has been demonstrated to generate 5 to 6 volts run at sufficiently high speeds.  Maximum current output has not been measured.  At some point, I'll construct a reliable way to run the generator, such that I can do a bit more testing and get some hard numbers.

Instructions for cutting and assembly will be provided at a later date.


**Measurement Notice:**

These are recent Inkscape files, which means that these files use the official SVG standard of 96 DPI.  This is important, because Adobe Illustrator and older versions of Inkscape are _not_ compliant with the SVG standard and use some other DPI resolution.  In practice, this means that loading these into other non-compliant programs may screw up the measurements and result in bad cuts that waste material.  Additionally, if your laser cutter software allows the SVG DPI to be set, you will want to set it to 96 to get accurate cuts.
